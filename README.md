# hackCooper2016 (Blue City Game)
This was our project for HackCooper 2016 in New York City.

##Synopsis
Blue City is a game for twitter where everybody can play and decide together what happens with the city. 
There are 4 cities in the game. Every hour a random event happens. 
For example:
- Blue City has a chance to trade with Green City. Should Blue City accept?
Then Twitter users can interact sending a twit with the hashtag #CityYes or #CityNo if they want to accept or not the proposal.

Also each city has 3 indicators: People, Army and Gold. If one of these indicators reaches 0 the city is destroyed.
The objective is that Blue City wins the others.
